This C++ program implements an inventory management system with features for managing suppliers, transportation costs, and product flow economics. It utilizes a graph data structure to represent suppliers and their relationships, along with additional details stored in the `Supplier` struct.

## Data Structure Used

The program employs two main data structures:
1. **Supplier Struct**: Represents details of each supplier, including:
   - Name: Name of the supplier.
   - Cost of Goods: Cost of goods provided by the supplier.
   - Location: Location of the supplier.
   - Contact Person: Contact person at the supplier's organization.
   - Email: Email address of the supplier.
   - Phone: Phone number of the supplier.

2. **Graph Representation**: Suppliers are stored in a hash table (`unordered_map`), where each supplier is a node in the graph. Transportation costs between suppliers are represented as edges in the graph.

## Functionalities

The inventory management system provides the following functionalities:

1. **Add Supplier**: Add a new supplier to the system with details such as name, cost of goods, location, contact person, email, and phone number.

2. **Add Transportation Cost**: Specify transportation costs between suppliers to capture the economics of product flow. Transportation costs are associated with edges in the graph representation.

3. **Display Suppliers**: Display the list of suppliers along with their details, including name, cost of goods, location, contact person, email, and phone number.

4. **Display Transportation Costs**: Display the transportation costs between suppliers to understand the cost implications of product flow.
