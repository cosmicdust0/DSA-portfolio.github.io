 # Modules 

-Ingredients: You can use a struct or a class to represent each ingredient, containing properties like name, cost per unit, and unit quantity needed per bottle.these all should be stored in data base .

-Production Cost: A variable or a struct can store the cost per unit of production (e.g., cost of operating machinery, labour). these all should be stored in database

# Implementation  of each module 

Category Tree for Ingredients :If we have a hierarchical category structure for ingredients, a separate tree can represent these relationship between the different food materials .
  
Production Cost: this is done using the Hash map , with the multiple categories of the costs involved the fetch needs to be fast .

marketing cost: we  can leverage a min-heap to find the cheapest advertising option based on target audience and reach requirements.

Populate Marketing Channels: Define data for each marketing channel as before.
Create MarketingChannelHeap: Create an instance of the MarketingChannelHeap class to store the channels.
findLeastCostlyOption Function:
Take the target audience and desired reach as arguments.
Iterate through the marketing channels.
Add each channel to the MarketingChannelHeap along with the desired reach, triggering calculation of the total cost within the addChannel function.
Call extractCheapest on the heap to retrieve the channel with the lowest total cost.
