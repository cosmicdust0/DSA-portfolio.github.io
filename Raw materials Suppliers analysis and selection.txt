# Inventory Management System

This C++ program manages inventory using a hash table data structure provided by the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). It allows users to add, remove, update quantity, and display inventory items efficiently.

## Features

- **Add Item**: Add new items to the inventory along with their details such as name, quantity, date of manufacture, shelf life, and condition to store in.
- **Remove Item**: Remove items from the inventory by specifying their name.
- **Update Quantity**: Update the quantity of existing items in the inventory.
- **Display Inventory**: Display all items in the inventory along with their details.

## Code Structure

- The program defines a `InventoryItem` struct to represent each inventory item, which includes fields for name, quantity, date of manufacture, shelf life, and condition to store in.
- It also defines a `InventoryManager` class to manage the inventory, with member functions for adding, removing, updating quantity, and displaying inventory items.
- The `getCurrentDateAsString()` function is a helper function to get the current date as a string, which is used to initialize the date of manufacture for new items.
