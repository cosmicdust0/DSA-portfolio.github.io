Data Structures:

Products:
Data Structure: AVL/Red-Black Tree (RBT)

 Efficient search (O(log n)) for product information based on ID or name is crucial for placement and retrieval. AVL/RBTs ensure balanced insertion and deletion, maintaining efficient lookup performance.

Key-Value Pairs:
Key: Product ID (unique identifier)
Value: Product object containing details (name, demand prediction, location, stock level, etc.)

Warehouse Layout:

Data Structure: Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

Rationale: The warehouse layout can be modeled as a DAG, where nodes represent storage units (shelves, bins) and directed edges represent feasible movement paths. A DAG is suitable because movement is typically one-directional within the warehouse.

Nodes: Warehouse storage units (shelves, bins) with attributes like capacity, available space, and product type suitability.

Edges: Directed connections between storage units representing feasible movement paths.

Inventory Management:
Data Structure: Hash Tables (Just-in-Time)


Algorithms:
Product Placement

Algorithm: A* Search (informed search)

Implementation:
 A* prioritizes search paths based on a heuristic that estimates the remaining distance (cost) to the goal location predicted by the ML model. This ensures efficient placement within the warehouse layout DAG, minimizing travel time.

Cost Function: Combines movement distance (e.g., Manhattan distance) between storage units in the warehouse layout DAG and a penalty for exceeding capacity constraints.
Heuristic: Estimates remaining distance to the ML-predicted location based on product attributes (e.g., demand, size, weight).

Hybrid Approach:
A hybrid approach that leverages both algorithms:

Initial Search with DFS: Start with a quick DFS search to explore potential paths from the current location.
BFS (Optional): If the initial DFS search doesn't find the product within a reasonable timeframe, switch to BFS to guarantee finding the shortest path.
This hybrid approach offers a balance between speed and efficiency.  The threshold for switching to BFS based on your specific warehouse setup and retrieval needs.
