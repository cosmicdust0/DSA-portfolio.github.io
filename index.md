# DSA involved:
This project utilizes various DSA techniques to enhance efficiency and decision-making in the supply chain. For example:

  * Graphs can represent the network of suppliers, warehouses, and distributors, enabling efficient route planning with algorithms like A*,  Dijkstra's algorithms etc.
  * Queues can be used to model inventory flow, ensuring First-In-First-Out (FIFO) or other inventory management strategies.
  * Sorting algorithms can be applied to prioritize orders or shipments based on urgency, cost, or other criteria.

By incorporating DSA principles, my project aims to achieve significant improvements in  cost savings, delivery speed, and customer satisfaction.


# Technology Stack:

* Programming language(s): (e.g., Python, Javascript )
* Libraries/Frameworks: (e.g., Django, React )


## Modules to be integrated
