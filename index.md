# DSA involved:
This project utilizes various DSA techniques to enhance efficiency and decision-making in the supply chain. For example:

  * Graphs can represent the network of suppliers, warehouses, and distributors, enabling efficient route planning with algorithms like A* ,  Dijkstra's algorithms etc.
  * Queues can be used to model inventory flow, ensuring First-In-First-Out (FIFO) or other inventory management strategies.
  * Sorting algorithms can be applied to prioritize orders or shipments based on urgency, cost, or other criteria.

By incorporating DSA principles, my project aims to achieve significant improvements in  cost savings, delivery speed, customer satisfaction.


# Technology Stack:

* Programming language(s): (e.g., Python,Javascript )
* Libraries/Frameworks: (e.g., Django, React )


## Modules to be integrated 

This system comprises several interconnected modules for streamlined supply chain management:

**1. Raw materials Suppliers analysis and selection:**

* Manages supplier data (contact information, product catalogues, lead times, quality records).
* Enables searching and filtering suppliers based on various criteria.
* Supports supplier performance evaluation and risk assessments.

**2. Economics/Finances of the complete product flow:**

* Handles cost calculations (raw materials, production, transportation, storage).
* Implements pricing models to optimize profitability.
* Analyzes economic trends and forecasts for informed decision-making.

**3. Storage for raw material, finished goods and other consumables:**

* Tracks inventory levels across various storage facilities.
* Optimizes inventory placement and allocation using appropriate data structures (e.g., graphs).
* Implements inventory management strategies (FIFO, LIFO, Just-in-Time).

**4. Production Strategies for efficient use of resources:**

* Models production processes using appropriate algorithms (e.g., scheduling algorithms).
* Optimizes production schedules to meet demand while minimizing costs and lead times.
* Analyzes production capacity and potential bottlenecks.

**5. Quality Control:**

* Defines and implements quality control procedures throughout the supply chain.
* Tracks and analyzes quality metrics (defect rates, customer satisfaction).
* Identifies potential quality issues and suggests corrective actions.

**6. Logistics management for maximised suitability and profits:**

* Optimizes transportation routes and modes (e.g., using shortest path algorithms).
* Forecasts delivery times and manages logistics costs.
* Tracks shipment status and provides real-time updates.

## Functionalities

This system empowers businesses with a range of functionalities to enhance supply chain performance:

**1. Analysis (Charts):**

* Generates insightful visualizations (charts, graphs) to represent key metrics (inventory levels, production costs, delivery times).
* Provides data analysis dashboards to monitor trends and identify areas for improvement.
* Uses data structures (e.g., trees) to facilitate efficient data organization and retrieval for visualization creation.

**2. Searching, Sorting (Data Structures):**

* Enables efficient searching of supplier data, inventory items, and historical records using appropriate data structures (e.g., hash tables, search trees).
* Implements sorting algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quick sort) to organize data efficiently based on various sorting criteria (price, availability, lead time).
* Data structures optimize search and sorting time complexity, leading to faster queries and better user experience.

**3. Prediction(ML):**

* Integrates machine learning models or forecasting techniques to predict future demand, supply disruptions, and potential quality issues.
* Utilizes historical data (stored efficiently using data structures like arrays and linked lists) to train prediction models.
* Predictions enable proactive decision-making and inventory management.

**4. Management(frontend Dashboard):**

* Provides tools to manage suppliers, inventory, production schedules, quality control processes, and logistics operations.
* Integrates appropriate data structures and algorithms to support efficient management tasks (e.g., priority queues for order fulfilment).
* Streamlines supply chain operations for improved efficiency.

**5. Calculations:**

* Offers functionalities to calculate costs, delivery times, lead times, resource usage, and other relevant metrics.
* Leverages algorithms (e.g., dynamic programming for some calculations) to optimize performance and accuracy.
* Provides valuable insights for cost reduction and better resource allocation.
