# Project Description:
This project demonstrates the application of data structures and algorithms (DSA) to optimize a specific aspect of supply chain management, such as inventory management, logistics planning, or route optimization. 


# DSA involved:
This project utilizes various DSA techniques to enhance efficiency and decision-making in the supply chain. For example:

  * Graphs can represent the network of suppliers, warehouses, and distributors, enabling efficient route planning with algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm.
  * Queues can be used to model inventory flow, ensuring First-In-First-Out (FIFO) or other inventory management strategies.
  * Sorting algorithms can be applied to prioritize orders or shipments based on urgency, cost, or other criteria.

By incorporating DSA principles, this project aims to achieve significant improvements in (mention specific metrics your project addresses, e.g., cost savings, delivery speed, customer satisfaction).


# Technology Stack:

* Programming language(s): (e.g., Python,Javascript )
* Libraries/Frameworks: (e.g., Django, React )
